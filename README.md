Hello!

For my final project of my Applied Probability and Statistics Class, I decided to investigate the correlation between COVID-19 cases and deaths with obesity rates across two different U.S. states. Based on their similar population densities and their differing obesity rates (further discussed in the project), I chose Colorado and Mississippi to be the two states to be analyzed for this project.  This was a team project, however I contributed all of the R code and edited the introduction, analysis, and conclusion.  I used an R markdown file (.Rmd) to merge my team's analysis with the data presented by my R code.  Additionally, the "Knit to HTML" feature on RStudio was used in order to knit the final product into an HTML document.

In regards to COVID-19 data, we used the COVID-19 Dataset curated by Johns Hopkins University: JHU COVID-19 Dataset. In regards to obesity rates and population densities, we extracted data from Statistica to obtain obesity rates by state to compare with the COVID-19 data.
